# 2D_contour

The plotcontour script helps in plotting 2D contour maps given continous or discontinous input data.

For example:
You have a sheet containing energy values against Phi and Psi dihedral angle both varying from -180 to 180 at 30 degree interval. 
But some of the energy values are missing. Such discontinous data needs interpolation of missing values. This script automates the process.
